# CSE109 Electrical Circuits

# Mini Project Voltage Divider and Selector Circuit


A 10V DC supply is available. In practice you need to use 10V, 5V, and 3V as supply voltage of a low current electrical circuit. Design a voltage divider circuit so that the desired voltage can be selected at the output.
